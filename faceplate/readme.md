# Cheap and cheerful faceplate option

## Not even close to done yet, do not order!

The faceplate design in this directory is a copy of the prototype faceplate, which was designed to fit a gutted Vibro Champ XD.

The new version uses a larger [JTM45 style chassis](https://www.mojotone.com/Undrilled-Aluminum-Chassis), the faceplate should be redesigned to fit the actual hardware.

Also, consider making the pilot light hole small so that a neon can be used. This way you can drill the hole out if you want a 6.3 volt lamp.
