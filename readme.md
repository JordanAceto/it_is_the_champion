# TODO

- see if there are schottky bridges for the DC heater
- try out the DC heater circuit and make sure it's ok
- consider adding fuses to the secondary circuits
- maybe the treble control should be audio taper, I have it turned down most of the time
- if you could find good 450v caps that are not so tall, you could shave off a bunch of the pcb
- make sure that v2 doesn't hit the speaker
