## [SCHEMATIC](https://github.com/JordanAceto/it_is_the_champion/blob/main/pcb/construction_docs/it_is_the_champion_schematic.pdf)

A prototype has been constructed and evaluated using a 6550 output tube. See the [prototype write up](https://github.com/JordanAceto/it_is_the_champion/blob/main/prototype/it_is_the_champion_prototype_write_up.pdf) for details. It sounds pretty good to me.

The GU50 output stage has been breadboarded. It seems to work well and gives a smidge more power out than the 6550 (I'm mostly just using it to be a hipster though).

Next steps:

Task | Status |

Schematic capture | &#9745;
PCB layout | &#9745;
Order boards and do test build | &#9745;
Front and rear panels | &#9744;
Generate complete BOM | &#9744;
